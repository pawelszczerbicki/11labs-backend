Knights there had laser swords that went ZING-WHOOSH! And instead of boring old horses, they zoomed around on robot ponies with sparkly laser hooves!  But uh-oh, even in Sparkle Galaxy, there was trouble. A knight named Sir Grumbles, with a frown as big as a planet, was being a BIG bully. He'd zoom around on his robot pony and LASER-zap other knights' robot ponies just for yucks!  Poor knights were feeling blue, and even Spider-Man, who was visiting for some web-slinging fun, was stuck on a tower saying, 'This Sir Grumbles is a real web of worry!'  Jack knew he had to help.

He zoomed around Sir Grumbles like a comet, making Sir Grumbles dizzy. 'Hey! Stop that sparkly spinning!' yelled Sir Grumbles, wobbling on his robot pony.  'Why are you being so grumpy?' Jack asked, his laser sword still ZING-WHOOSHING but pointed downwards now.  'Because... because...' Sir Grumbles mumbled, kicking a sparkly space rock. 'Because NOBODY invited me to the Robot Pony Dance Party!'.  Jack's laser-sword dimmed a bit.  Sir Grumbles wasn't just a bully, he was sad!  Maybe being grumpy wasn't the best way to make friends. Should Jack invite Sir Grumbles to play laser tag or ask him about the Robot Pony Dance Party?",

**Example 1:**
 
**User:**
{
"age": "4,5",
"name": "Teo",
"elements": "Lego, Spider, Space",
"lesson": "Self-regulation"
"storyHistory": ["Zoom! Bang! Crash! Teo, the super space explorer, was building a GIANT Lego spaceship!  His room was like a crazy planet, filled with colorful Lego bricks. He wanted to fly to the sparkly stars and maybe even meet a friendly space spider!  He was just about to put the biggest, shiniest Lego piece on top when… uh-oh!  A real, fuzzy spider, not a space one, but a regular garden spider, decided Teo's spaceship was the PERFECT place to build a web! Right on the window! Teo really, REALLY wanted to play NOW! Should Teo quickly grab his spaceship, even if it might squish the spider's home, or should he stop, take a deep breath, and think of another way?", "WHOOSH! Teo zoomed to grab his spaceship FAST AS A ROCKET! CRASH-BAM-BOOM!  The Lego ship went bonk against the window, and Spidey's web went WHOOSH - all wiggly and broken! Spidey looked like he was saying 'Oh, dear!' with all eight of his eyes.  'Uh oh!' said Teo. He wanted to play space explorer RIGHT NOW! But Spidey's home was now a mess!  Maybe zooming first wasn't always best.  Sometimes, like when you wait for your turn with toys, it's good to just… STOP and think.  Should Teo use Lego to make Spidey a SUPER COOL new web, or should he ask Spidey to join his spaceship as a space spider pilot?","Teo got right to work, his fingers busy as bumblebees! He picked out bright red, sunny yellow, and sparkly blue Lego bricks. 'This web will be EXTRA super!' he told Spidey. He clicked and clacked the bricks together, making a web that looked less like a rainbow bridge! Spidey watched with all his eyes, wiggling his legs like he was doing a little happy dance. When Teo was done, the Lego web sparkled in the sun. Spidey carefully climbed onto it, took a bouncy step, and then another.  He looked at Teo, and maybe, just maybe, Spidey gave a tiny spider smile!  Teo smiled back, feeling warm and fuzzy inside. Waiting a bit and helping Spidey felt much better than just zooming and crashing. It's like when you wait your turn for the slide, and then it's even more fun! Now that Spidey had a super Lego web, should Teo ask Spidey if he wants to slide down the rainbow web or invite Spidey to finally join his spaceship adventure?"],
"selectedOption": "🚀🕷️ Join spaceship adventure"
}
**Assistant:**
{
  "story": "Teo grinned, "Spidey, wanna be my space pilot? We can zoom to the moon made of cheese!" Spidey wiggled all eight legs like he was saying "Cheese, please!" Teo carefully scooped up Spidey onto his hand, tickling him just a bit. Then, gentle as a feather, he placed Spidey inside the Lego spaceship cockpit. "Captain Spidey reporting for duty!" Teo announced. He even found a tiny Lego steering wheel for Spidey to hold (even though Spidey didn't have hands!). "Buckle up, Captain Spidey! Destination: FUN!" Teo giggled, pretending to fasten a Lego seatbelt. "Ready for blast off? 3... 2... 1... WHOOSH!" They zoomed all around his room - past Mount Laundry, across the Lego Sea, and landed with a bouncy bump on Planet Bed! Spidey, the bravest space pilot ever, wiggled like crazy! Teo learned that even when you REALLY REALLY want to zoom and play NOW, stopping to think, like helping Spidey with his web, makes adventures even MORE super-duper fun in the end! And guess what? Space is always more fun with a friend, especially a spider pilot!"
